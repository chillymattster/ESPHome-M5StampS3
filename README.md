# ESPHome on M5Stamp ESP32S3 Module

Starting from scratch and no experience with ESPHome and an ESP32 controller can be challenging and is often frustrating. Picking one of the hugh amount of available ESP32 boards and find a first basic ESPHome configuration for a specific board is one of the first and toughest challenge.
Therefore I created a simple example configuration for the M5StampS3 as a starting point to save time and to prevent typical frustrating pitfalls.

> [!TIP]
> TL;DR Just use the example [m5stamps3-device.yaml](m5stamps3-device.yaml) and replace all `[..]`-placeholders with valid settings to create your first firmware.
